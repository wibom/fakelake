The company's aim is to measure all small molecules (<1500 Da) in a biological sample. These small-molecule compounds include biochemicals of cellular metabolism and xenobiotics from diet and environment. Our proprietary mLIMStrade mark system contains advanced metabolomic software and automated data-processing tools that use a variety of data-analysis and quality-control algorithms to convert raw mass-spectrometry data to identified, quantitated compounds. Metabolon's primary focus is a fee-for-service business that exploits this technology for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, with additional clients in the consumer goods, cosmetics and agricultural industries. Fee-for-service studies are often collaborations with groups that employ a variety of technologies for biomarker discovery. Metabolon's goal is to develop technology that will automatically analyze any sample for the small-molecule components present and become a standard technology for applications in health and related sciences.\n","subject_terms1":"cancer","subject_terms2":"brain tumor","subject_terms3":"gbm","subject_terms4":"glioma","PI.name":"Beatrice Melin","PI.email":"beatrice.melin@umu.se","PI.uni":"UmeÃ¥ University","PI.faculty":"Medical Faculty","PI.department":"Radiation Sciences","ethics.comment":"optional freetext","ethics.1":{"type":"main","dnr":"2017/295-31M","date":"2020-01-01","comment":"pertaining to cohort-X"},"ethics.2":{"type":"amendment","dnr":"2017/295-31M","date":"2022-01-01","comment":"optional freetext"},"publicaitons.1":{"doi":"10.2217/14622416.8.7.863","pmid":"17638516","arXive":{},"other":{}},"dataset.filename":"PLACEHOLDER_FILENAME","dataset.type":"proteomics","dataset.analysesplatform":"Olink","dataset.embargo":"2025-01-01","data.filename":"/fakelake/1_bronze/x1/data_2/mock_Olink_NPX_1791-02-02.csv","data.type":"proteomics","data.analysesplatform":"Olink","data.embargo":"2025-01-01"}
