The company's aim is to measure all small molecules (<1500 Da) in a biological sample. These small-molecule compounds include biochemicals of cellular metabolism and xenobiotics from diet and environment. Our proprietary mLIMStrade mark system contains advanced metabolomic software and automated data-processing tools that use a variety of data-analysis and quality-control algorithms to convert raw mass-spectrometry data to identified, quantitated compounds. Metabolon's primary focus is a fee-for-service business that exploits this technology for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, with additional clients in the consumer goods, cosmetics and agricultural industries. Fee-for-service studies are often collaborations with groups that employ a variety of technologies for biomarker discovery. Metabolon's goal is to develop technology that will automatically analyze any sample for the small-molecule components present and become a standard technology for applications in health and related sciences.  \n"},"dataset.filename":"/fakelake/1_bronze/x1/data_1/mock_UMEA-01-19ML+CDT_EDTA_PLASMA_01JAN1789.XLSX","dataset.datatype":"metabolomics","dataset.analytics_platform":"Metabolon","dataset.embargo":"2025-01-01"}
